== Purpose

This repository contains three shell scripts that can be used to create and manage temporary Azure OpenAI resources for use in local development as follows:

To create resources, update the environment variables in `aoaicreate.sh` and then run the script with 'source ./aoaicreate.sh'.

To destroy resources, run './aoaidestroy.sh'.
NOTE: Env vars from aoaicreate.sh are required for aoaidestroy.sh to work; otherwise, provide the required values as arguments.

Useful assorted commands are contained within the file `aoaiutilities.sh`.
NOTE: This file does not have exec permissions by default as it isn't so much a script as a collection of commands to be run in the shell. Currently. At this moment. It could change. You never know. üòÅ
